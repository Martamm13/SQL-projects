-- US Household Income Data Analysis
-- The queries explore and analyze household income data
-- First, I get and review the full dataset to set a baseline
-- Next, I identify states with the largest land and water areas
-- I then combine and compare data from the household income and statistics tables
-- To ensure accuracy, I check for discrepancies and remove records with zero income
-- I analyze income data to find states with the highest and lowest average incomes
-- Additional queries look at specific data types and summarize statistics based on record counts
-- Finally, I calculate average incomes by city for a detailed view of income distribution

-- Select All Data
-- Purpose: Get all rows and columns from the household income table for initial review
SELECT *
FROM us_project.us_household_income
;

-- Top 10 States by Land Area
-- Purpose: Find the top 10 states with the largest land areas
SELECT State_Name, SUM(ALand), SUM(AWater)
FROM us_project.us_household_income
GROUP BY State_Name
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10
;

-- Top 10 States by Water Area
-- Purpose: Find the top 10 states with the largest water areas
SELECT State_Name, SUM(ALand), SUM(AWater)
FROM us_project.us_household_income
