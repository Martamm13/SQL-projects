# SQL Projects Collection

Welcome to the SQL Projects Collection! This repository contains a selection of my SQL projects focused on data analysis and data cleaning. Each project showcases my skills in working with real-world datasets to extract meaningful insights.

## Projects 

- [World-Life-Expectancy](World-Life-Expectancy) - a data cleaning project using MySQL. In this project, I worked with World Life Expectancy data to prepare it for analysis by writing efficient MySQL queries.

Feel free to explore the folders to see the SQL scripts and results. If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please create an issue or reach out.

Happy querying!
